# Writing 1
	The author in the reading deems that broches that appeared in ancient England has various possible uses. The lecture, however, claims that all the possibilites mentioned in the reading is lack of supporting.
	Firstly, according to the reading passage, the broches might be used to deter attack for ancient Scots, due to its high and thick wall could be the perfect line of defense. In sharp contrast, the lecturer makes an objection that since the broches has no windows outside, it could never be used for defense, because the defenders couldn't shoot arrows nor even spot on the attackers, which allows the enemies to easily set the defenders on fire or break the broches by ramming the door.
	Secondly, whereas the author believes that the broches could be used for storing foods, as the broches seemed to be quite suitable to restore the overwhelming crops at that time due to the increasing agriculture production. However, the lecturer points out several details that was missing in this case. He argues that the water tanks and the fireplaces found in the broches proved it wrong. The former ones could produce moisture that could easily corrupt the crops, while the latter ones will easily trigger fire or even explosion with the dust from the grain.
	Lastly, the author claims that the broches might be used for social purpose. He believes that the broches could be served for high chieftains' inhabitat due to its elaborate structure. However, the lecturer has different point of view. He first listed that the habitat for chieftains are typically surrounded by small houses clustering together, which is in conflict with the seperated broches. Moreover, the broches found seemed to be closed with each other, which is quite improper for a chief's habitat.
