- Core term: `cognitive dissonance`
### Reading Note-taking and expressing
1. 定位标题术语(term)在文章出现的位置（第一次），找包含术语的句子

3. 提示句中如果含有代词如`this`（`these`等）的时候，基本上前一句就是定义句
4. 如果没有代词提示，术语后面一句可能就是定义句
5. 术语前面有`through`或者`by`等表示方式的连接词，需要关注后一句

For example, a certain movement or physical eature might evolve to serve as a signal or a warning that other animals will understand. Once a behavior is ritualized, it becomes a form of communication; therefore, if an animal engages in this behavior, other animals will
