# Field
## Definition
An algebraic structure consisting of a set $F$ and two operations $(a, b) \mapsto a + b$  (addition) and $(a, b) \mapsto a\cdot  b = ab$ (multiplication), which satisfy the usual laws of algebra known from $\mathbb{R}$. 
In particular, there must exist two distinguished elements $0, 1 \in F$ satisfying $a + 0 = a$ and $a Â· 1 = a$ for  $\forall \space a \in F$, and all equations $a + x = b$ ($a, b \in F$) and $ax = b$ ($a, b \in F, a \neq 0$) must be **uniquely solvable** (thus providing definitions of differences $a - b = a + (-b)$ and quotients $\frac{a}{b} = a \cdot b^{-1}$)
