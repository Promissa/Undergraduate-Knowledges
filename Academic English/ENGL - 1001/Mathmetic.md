   The problems we want to solve is how many gold in campus cellphones. We've found that there's an average about 0.034g gold in one phone. Lets assume there're 1300 undergraduates, 800 graduates, and 400 professors and workers, who all have a cellphone.  So let 0.034 times the sum of 1300, 800, 400, which is 2500, equals 85. So there's approximately 85g gold in campus cellphones.
