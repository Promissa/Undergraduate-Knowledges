I'm Peiran Wei, coming from Hangzhou which enjoys reputation for  its picturesque scenery of West Lake. Photograph, music and astronomy are my hobby, and I joined my high school's astronomy club as well. For me, studying is to enhancing myself and help me explore more of this world. Mostly I use pen to writing, and library is the best place for me to do some studying or writing.
