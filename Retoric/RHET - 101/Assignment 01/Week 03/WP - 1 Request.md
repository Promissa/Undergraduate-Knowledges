_This assignment will require you to reflect on an important part of your identity as a scholar: Your Writing Life. It addresses Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs):_

_#1 "Distinguish between the conventions of academic and non-academic texts (print and/or multimodal)." and_

_#5: "Describe and reflect on their own writing processes, including revisions made in consideration of peer and/or instructor feedback."_

Write a 4-5 page essay about your writing life. This is a personal exploration. It can include a narrative about your early writing years: how you learned to write (and to read), your techniques, influences, habits, likes/dislikes about writing. You can write about your past, present and future relationships to writing. Include various contexts—writing for school, but also letters to your grandparents, and notes you may have passed in class (or texted?), writing you may do in your future career.

How do you feel about writing in various contexts? What lessons have you learned? What are your favorite tools? (Consider "hardware," like computer keyboards, pencils or pens, and "software," like spell check, word processors, paperback dictionaries, your own vocabulary.) What practices nurture your writing? You may want to consider your _reading_ life as well. 

Your writing life is a journey, and your relationship to literacy (both reading and writing) will likely change many times over the years, and probably change when you shift genre. (For example, how do you think of yourself as a writer of an academic paper versus the composer of a post on WeChat or a commenter on Instagram? Do you feel varying degrees of enjoyment or competence with each genre? ) 

In your essay, describe (_**summarize**_!) your writing practice. What do you do when you first get an assignment? (What did you do when you first got _this_ assignment?) What advice have you heard from past teachers or friends? Also you will need to _**analyze**_ your writing methods. What parts of your practice will help you succeed in the academic community? What parts of your practice might hinder you? Can you find room for improvement? What advice might you give to a friend who is struggling with writing?

_Hint: for this assignment your basic thesis should be "**This** is my writing practice." To make that thesis even more focused, you should describe how your writing practice **identifies, influences, and nurtures you as a scholar**._

Here are the details:

-   Your exploratory draft will be due Friday, October 7 at 5 PM.
-   Your Workshop is Thursday, October 13 in class.
-   Final draft due Thursday, October 20, at 8 AM.  

## Grading Criteria

When I grade your essay I look for the following:

-   A concise and descriptive **title**.
-   A clear and focused **thesis**. (Not necessarily a thesis _statement_ in the first paragraph, but I should know what your thesis is by the time I finish reading your paper.) Hint: for this assignment your basic thesis should be "_**This**_ is my writing practice." To make that thesis even more focused, you should describe how your writing practice **_identifies_**, _**influences**_, and _**nurtures**_ you as a scholar.  
-   Vivid, detailed **description** of your writing life.
-   Thoughtful **analysis** of your writing practices. 
-   Clear **organization** of your material into coherent paragraphs.
-   Clear, **error-free** writing.
-   Correct **documentation** of any sources used. (Note that the assignment does not require the use of sources. However, should you chose to use them, you need to cite them.)
