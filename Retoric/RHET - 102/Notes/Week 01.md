## Stephen Toulmin
An arguments may have six parts.
### Three Required Parts
1. **Thesis (or claim)** *Main Point*: The main point that the author is trying to make
2. **Support (or data)** *More Logos*: Smaller claims that back up or “support” the thesis
3. **Warrant (or assumption)** *Kind like Pathos*: Often unstated. They’re author’s assumptions or values (and they hope readers will share).
### Three Optional Parts
1. **Qualifier**: Limits the thesis in some way. Look for the language of possility. (*Sometimes, Often, Maybe, If, etc.*)
2. **Backing**: A kind of support. Strengthens the warrent (which may be unstated). Used when the audience didn’t share your values
3. **Rebuttal**: The writer anticipates an objection from the audience and provides further argument to address that objection.

### Automatic Writing on Class
White’s mother told White to always greet people you meet in White’s childhood on the neighborhood street, because she thought greetings could be really important to others. And that plays as White’s motto in rest of his life. White believes that all people’s presence should be acknowledged by others, so a simple greeting like “Hello” may mean more to others than you imagine. Even White had become the vice president of America, he still kept on this principle, greeting every people he meet. 
For me, unlike White, I only greet to my friend on campus and canteen or group mates I met in the classroom.
