# Moral theory  (Normative ethics)  
- Moral theory tries to answer general moral questions about what to do and how to be: what makes actions right or wrong, what makes things good or bad, what makes people virtuous or vicious.
- A moral theory aims to provide **general moral principles**, very general statements that purport to set forth conditions under which an action/behaviour is right or wrong, or something is good or bad.
Structure of the Principles: An action A is right/wrong/… *if and only if (and because)* A has property P.
## Theories
### Consequentialism
- Principle: An action A is obligatory if (and because) A would produce a better consequences (e.g., higher level of utility) than any other alternative action.
- Methodology: Consider the consequences of your decision, whether it will bring about good or bad consequences for you and other people.
### Kantian Deontologism
- Principle: Act as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of nature” (Alternative: treat other persons always as ends in themselves, never merely as means).
- Methodology
	- Repect other people, respect their rights.
	- Don't treat others as mere means to achieve your purposes.
	- Don't do what you don't want everybody else to do
### Rossian Deontologism
- Principle: There are several basic moral principles  (prima facie duties) that must be respected other things being equal. In case of conflicts of prima facie duties, one should satisfy the most ”strict” duty.
- Methodology: When you face a decision, consider and weigh many aspects in the situation and their relative importance: your commitments, the good or harm you could bring to others, etc.
### Virtue Ethics
- Principle: An action A in a context C is right if and only if (and because) A is an action that a virtuous agent does or would do in C.
- Methodology
	- When you face a decision, first think what a virtuous person whould do if she/he were in your place.
	- Try to adopt moderate dispositions and avoid vicious extremes.
### Natural Law Theory
- Principle: An action A is right if and only if (and because) either A preserves and promotes the realization of natural human purposes (life, procreation, knowledge and sociability); or it doesn’t prevent or obstacle these purposes.
- Methodology
	-  Don't do things against nature. Try to realize your abilities, and help promoting and do not obstacle the realization of others.
	- Your intentions matter: do not intend to cause bad effects.
