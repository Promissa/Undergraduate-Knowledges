## A short introduction
### What is Ethics?
- A possible definition: *Ethics is the domain of philosophy concerned with moral normativity.*
	- What is normativity?
		- Normativity has to do with things such as values, norms, rules, duties, rights, virtues and vices… Normative notions involve assessments or evaluations of someone or something. 
		- Expressions normally used for normative evaluations and appraisals: “good”, “bad”, “better/worse than” “should”, “ought”, “may”, “is permitted to”, “is forbidden to”, “is prohibited” “has a duty to”, “is right/wrong”, “is required to”.

## Classic Utilitarianism
==**Maxmize the advantage, minimize the disadvantage**==
### Objections
**Classic Utilirarianism conflicts with our ordinary model intuitions**
- CU justifies highly inequitable distributiv justice models
	Example: Which society is more just/moral?
	- Society A: 10% Rich with +1000u; 90% poor with 0u
	- Society B: 50% Rich with +100u; 50% poor with +50u
	As CU claims, Society A is more moral for the amount of wealth is more. Yet due to ordinary model intuitions, clearly Society B is more just.
- The respect for individual rights is not a condition of the theory (e.g. utilitarian considerations used to justify slavery)
## Deontologism
### Types of contemporary deontologisms
- Duty-based agent-centered deontologism
	Morality is constituted by duties, obligations to do or not to do certain actions
- Rights-based victim- or patient-centered deontology.
	Morality is constituted by rights (right to respect for individual freedom, autonomy, etc.)
### Two theories
- Kantian Deontologism
	There's only one, exceptionless norm (the Categorical Imperative). It's always wrong to disobey such norm, no matter what.
	Moral normsare norms of reason (not derived from expeerience). These norms are valid universally for all ratinoal agents (not only human beings).
	Practical reason is the faculty/capacity to deliberate about what to do and make free choices. It determines under which conditions we are rational.
	The principles of practical reason set forth requirements for deliberating and choosing raionally.
- Rossian Deontologism
	There're many norms, each admitting possible exception.
