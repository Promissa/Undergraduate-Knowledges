An arguments may have six parts.
## Three Required Parts
1. **Thesis (or claim)** *Main Point*: The main point that the author is trying to make
2. **Support (or data)** *More Logos*: Smaller claims that back up or “support” the thesis
3. **Warrant (or assumption)** *Kind like Pathos*: Often unstated. They’re author’s assumptions or values (and they hope readers will share), usually is something the author values.
## Three Optional Parts
1. **Qualifier**: Limits the thesis in some way. Look for the language of possility. (*Sometimes, Often, Maybe, If, etc.*)
2. **Backing**: A kind of support. Strengthens the warrant (which may be unstated). Used when the audience didn’t share your values
3. **Rebuttal**: The writer anticipates an objection from the audience and provides further argument to address that objection.
